## Blogs API

The project was developed at the end of Trybe's 24th block, in which I studied _Sequelize and JWT (JSON Web Token)_.

### How it works

In this project, I developed an **API Restfull** using **Sequelize** and **JWT**. We created a database that simulates a blog, where users, after logged (with JWT verifications), can read, search, delete and add posts.
I produced Sequelize's migrations and models, even as the controller's and service's layers.
After I finished the project, I decided to refactor my codes, splitting them to make them more organized and avoid repeating codes.
